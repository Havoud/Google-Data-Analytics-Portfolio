# Google Data Analytics Capstone (Cyclistic Project)

### by Hamed Davoudabadi

## Scenario
You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. As a result, the director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. So, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. The director of marketing and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.
